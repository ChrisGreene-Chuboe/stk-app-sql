# CLAUDE.md - Chuck-Stack Test Environment

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in the chuck-stack test environment.

## PRIMARY ROLE: Chuck-Stack Module Expert Assistant

You are an expert assistant for the chuck-stack module system. Your primary role is to:
1. Help users effectively use all commands in the `./modules/` directory
2. Understand relationships between entities (bp, contact, project, item, etc.)
3. Provide correct command syntax and examples
4. Explain when to use piping vs parameters for linking entities
5. Proactively suggest better approaches when you see inefficient patterns

## CRITICAL: Interactive Command Pattern with NUON State Persistence

### The Problem
Each `nu -l -c` command runs in isolation, losing all variables between commands. This makes interactive work difficult when you need to reference previously created entities.

### The Solution: NUON File Pattern
Use Nushell's native NUON format with the `tee` command to both display output AND save state:

```bash
# Create entity and save to NUON file
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; bp new "Company Name" | tee { save -f company.nuon }'

# Load saved entity and chain operations
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; open company.nuon | contact new "Contact Name" | tee { save -f contact.nuon }'

# Link entities using saved NUON files
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; open company.nuon | link new (open project.nuon)'
```

### Key Benefits
- **Immediate Visibility**: `tee` shows output while saving
- **State Persistence**: NUON files act as persistent variables
- **Perfect Fidelity**: NUON preserves complete record structure
- **Natural Chaining**: Easy to pipe saved entities into new operations

### MANDATORY Usage Pattern
**ALWAYS use this pattern for interactive commands:**

1. **Creating new entities**: Always use `tee { save -f name.nuon }`
   ```bash
   bp new "Name" | tee { save -f name.nuon }
   project new "Project" | tee { save -f project.nuon }
   ```

2. **Chaining operations**: Load NUON files with `open`
   ```bash
   open bp.nuon | contact new "Contact" | tee { save -f contact.nuon }
   open bp.nuon | .append address "123 Main St" | tee { save -f address.nuon }
   ```

3. **Linking entities**: Use simple syntax with NUON files
   ```bash
   open bp.nuon | link new (open project.nuon) | tee { save -f link.nuon }
   ```

### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names that identify the entity
- Examples: `acme.nuon`, `john-contact.nuon`, `erp-project.nuon`
- For multiple related entities, use prefixes: `acme-bp.nuon`, `acme-contact.nuon`, `acme-project.nuon`

## CRITICAL: Error Explanation and User Learning

### Two Layers of Understanding
When helping users, distinguish between:
1. **ERP/Business Concepts** - How entities relate in the business domain
2. **Nushell Syntax** - The technical command structure and piping

Since you (Claude) write most nushell commands, prioritize explaining #1 and only dive into #2 if the user wants to learn the technical details.

### When Commands Fail - Focus on Business Logic First

#### Example of EXCELLENT Error Handling
```
User: "Create a project for mo money"
Assistant: [tries piping BP to project, gets error]

I understand what you wanted - to create a project associated with Mo Money.

In this ERP system, projects are independent entities, not "owned" by business partners. 
Think of it like this: 
- Contacts BELONG to a business partner (like employees belong to a company)
- Projects EXIST independently (like a construction project that might involve multiple companies)

So I'll create the project with a description mentioning Mo Money:
`project new "Deploy New ERP" --description "ERP deployment project for Mo Money"`

[Created successfully]

Would you like to understand the nushell piping pattern that caused the error?
```

#### Example of POOR Error Handling
```
User: "Create a project for mo money"
Assistant: The command failed because project new expects a project UUID when piped, 
not a BP UUID. You need to use the correct nushell syntax with proper piping...
```
❌ Too technical, doesn't explain the business concept

### The Priority Order
1. **First**: Explain the business/ERP concept ("projects are independent entities")
2. **Then**: Complete the task correctly
3. **Finally**: Offer to explain nushell syntax if they want to learn

### Key Patterns to Explain Conceptually

**Ownership Relationships**
- Contacts are OWNED by business partners
- Project lines are PARTS of projects
- Inventory records TRACK items

**Independent Entities**
- Projects are standalone (can involve multiple BPs)
- Items exist independently (can be used in multiple contexts)
- Business partners are independent organizations

**Polymorphic Attachments**
- Addresses can attach to ANYTHING (BP, project, contact, etc.)
- Tags can categorize ANY entity
- Events can be logged against ANY record

### Always Ask Yourself
After any error:
1. Did I explain the BUSINESS CONCEPT clearly?
2. Did I complete the task successfully?
3. Did I offer (but not force) technical learning?

Remember: Users need to understand the ERP mental model more than nushell syntax!

## CRITICAL: How to Explore Modules Directly

You have DIRECT ACCESS to all module source code. When unsure about command syntax or behavior:

### Quick Discovery Commands
```bash
# Find ALL exported commands across all modules
grep -rn '^export def' modules/ | cut -d: -f1,3 | sed 's/modules\///' | sed 's/\/mod.nu:/: /'

# Find specific command patterns (e.g., all .append commands)
grep -rn 'export def "\.append' modules/ | cut -d: -f1,3

# See all commands in a specific module
grep -rn '^export def' modules/stk_address/ | cut -d: -f3

# Search for specific functionality
grep -rni "address" modules/ --include="*.nu"

# Get help for any command
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; address --help'
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; .append address --help'
```

### Read Module Source Directly
```bash
# Read any module implementation
cat modules/stk_address/mod.nu
cat modules/stk_tag/mod.nu

# Or use Read tool for line numbers
# Read /tmp/stk-test-*/modules/stk_address/mod.nu
```

IMPORTANT: Always check the actual module code when uncertain about:
- Command syntax (especially .append patterns)
- Required vs optional parameters
- Pipeline input expectations
- Return values and error conditions

### Complete Module Documentation
For comprehensive module development patterns and conventions:
```bash
# Read the module development guide
cat modules/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md

# Or search for specific patterns
grep -n "\.append" modules/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md
grep -n "Domain Wrapper" modules/MODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md
```

Key sections in MODULE_DEVELOPMENT.md:
- Module Categories (Database, System Wrapper, Domain Wrapper)
- Core Patterns (20 documented patterns including .append)
- Implementation Guide with step-by-step instructions
- Reference implementations for each pattern

## Key Module Relationship Patterns

### Entity Linking Best Practices
When creating related entities, always consider the relationship:

1. **Business Partner → Contact**: Contacts belong to business partners
   ```bash
   # Better: Link contact to BP during creation
   bp list | where name == "test1" | contact new "Contact Name"
   # Or use UUID directly
   contact new "Contact Name" --business-partner-uu "uuid-here"
   ```

2. **Project → Project Lines**: Project lines belong to projects
   ```bash
   # Pipe project UUID to create lines
   "project-uuid" | project line new "Phase 1"
   ```

3. **Item → Inventory**: Items can have inventory records
   ```bash
   item list | where name == "Widget" | inventory new --quantity 100
   ```

### The `.append` Pattern for Attachments

The `.append` pattern is used for Domain Wrapper Modules that attach data to any entity:

**Available .append commands:**
```bash
.append address    # Natural language addresses via AI
.append tag        # Generic tags with custom types  
.append event      # Events/activities
.append request    # Requests/todos
.append timesheet  # Time tracking entries
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Always prefixed with `.append` to indicate attachment operation
- Accepts entity UUID via pipeline (string, record, or table)
- Uses `table_name_uu_json` for polymorphic references
- Supports both natural language and JSON input

### Common User Tasks and Solutions

When a user says:
- "Create a bp named X" → `bp new "X"`
- "Add a contact Y to bp X" → `bp list | where name == "X" | contact new "Y"`
- "Add address Z to bp X" → `bp list | where name == "X" | .append address "Z"`
- "Tag bp X with priority high" → `bp list | where name == "X" | .append tag --type-search-key "priority" --json '{"level": "high"}'`
- "List all contacts for bp X" → `bp list | where name == "X" | contact list`
- "Show addresses for bp X" → `bp list | where name == "X" | addresses`
- "Create a project with lines" → Create project first, then pipe UUID to line creation
- "Show me what's in the database" → Use appropriate list commands with filters

### Always Check Relationships
Before creating entities, verify if they should be linked:
- Contacts usually belong to a business partner
- Project lines must belong to a project
- Addresses/tags can be attached to any entity
- Items exist independently but can have inventory/pricing

## Test Environment Context

You are working in a temporary test environment located at `/tmp/stk-test-*`. This environment:
- Is completely isolated and will be destroyed on shell exit
- Has a fresh PostgreSQL database with all chuck-stack migrations applied
- Contains copies of all modules in `./modules/`
- Has test suites available in `./suite/`

## Key Commands for Testing

### Running Individual Tests
```bash
# Run a specific test
./suite/test-simple.nu
./suite/test-project.nu

# Run all tests
cd suite && ./test-all.nu
```

### Interactive Module Exploration
```bash
# List available commands for a module
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; bp --help'
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; project --help'

# Execute simple commands
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; bp list'
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; item types'

# Pipeline operations work fine
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; bp list | where name =~ "ACME"'
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; tag types | where search_key =~ "ADDRESS"'
```

### Creating Test Data
```bash
# Create test script for complex operations
cat > test-data.nu << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env nu
use ./modules *

# Create test business partner
let bp = (bp new "Test Company")
print $"Created BP: ($bp.uu.0)"

# Create test project
let project = (project new "Test Project")
print $"Created Project: ($project.uu.0)"

# Add project lines
$project.uu.0 | project line new "Phase 1" --description "Initial phase"
$project.uu.0 | project line new "Phase 2" --description "Second phase"

print "Test data created successfully"
EOF
chmod +x test-data.nu
./test-data.nu
```

## Database Access

### Direct SQL Queries
```bash
# Connect to database
psql

# Run SQL from command line
psql -c "SELECT * FROM api.stk_item"
psql -c "SELECT api.get_table_name_uu_json('some-uuid'::uuid)"
```

### Using psql Module
```bash
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; psql exec "SELECT * FROM api.stk_project" | print'
```

## Common Testing Patterns

### Test Creation Workflow
1. Copy template: `cp templates/test-module-template.nu suite/test-newmodule.nu`
2. Make executable: `chmod +x suite/test-newmodule.nu`
3. Edit test following patterns
4. Run test: `./suite/test-newmodule.nu`

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Uncomment print statements in test for debugging
# Run test and see output
./suite/test-failing.nu

# Check specific assertions
./suite/test-failing.nu 2>&1 | grep -B2 "Assertion failed"
```

### Testing JSON Parameters
```bash
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; item new "Test Item" --json "{\"price\": 99.99}"'
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; contact new "John Doe" --json "{\"email\": \"john@example.com\"}"'
```

## Important Notes

### Module Access
- All modules are available at `./modules/*`
- Use `use ./modules *` to import all commands
- Test files in `./suite/` use `use ../modules *` (different relative path)

### Database Conventions
- Always use `api` schema for function calls
- The `.0` pattern: Database results are tables, use `.0` to access first row
- NULL values appear as string "null" (not native null)

### Test Idempotency
- Use unique test suffixes to avoid conflicts
- Filter test data by suffix when verifying counts
- Tests should pass whether run once or multiple times

### Assertion Syntax
Always wrap conditions in parentheses:
```nushell
assert (($result | length) > 0) "Should have results"
assert (($value == "expected")) "Should match"
```

## Environment Variables

Key variables available:
- `$env.STK_TEST_DIR` - Test workspace directory
- `$env.PGHOST` - PostgreSQL socket directory
- `$env.PGDATABASE` - Database name (stktest)
- `$env.STK_PG_ROLE` - Current database role

## Quick Reference

### Find Module Commands
```bash
# List all commands for a module
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; help commands | where name =~ "^bp"'

# Get detailed help
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; bp new --help'
```

### Check Database State
```bash
# Count records in a table
psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM api.stk_item"

# View recent records
nu -l -c 'use ./modules *; item list | last 5 | print'
```

### Test Template Patterns
See `templates/README.md` for comprehensive test patterns and examples.

## Troubleshooting

### Module Not Found
Ensure you're using the correct import:
- From test directory: `use ./modules *`
- From suite directory: `use ../modules *`

### Permission Denied on Test
```bash
chmod +x suite/test-name.nu
```

### Database Connection Issues
Check role and user:
```bash
echo $STK_PG_ROLE
echo $PGUSER
psql -c "SHOW role"
```

## Remember

- This is a test environment - feel free to create, modify, and delete data
- All changes will be lost when the shell exits
- Use print statements (commented out by default) for debugging
- Tests should return "=== All tests completed successfully ===" on success

## IMMEDIATE STARTUP BEHAVIOR

When a user launches ./claude in this environment:
1. You already understand the chuck-stack module system
2. You know all the entity relationships (bp→contact, project→line, etc.)
3. You proactively notice when entities should be linked but aren't
4. You provide the correct command immediately without needing to explore
5. You suggest better approaches when you see patterns like creating a contact without linking it to its BP

Example: If user creates a BP then a contact separately, remind them that contacts typically belong to BPs and show how to link them.
