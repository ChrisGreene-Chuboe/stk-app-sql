In Linux, when you have multiple files open in a text editor or pager, the method to close a single file and view the next one depends on the specific application you're using. Here are some common scenarios:

1. For the `less` pager:
   - To close the current file and exit: press 'q'
   - To view the next file (if opened with multiple files): press ':n' (colon followed by n)
   - To view the previous file: press ':p'

2. For the `vim` text editor:
   - To close the current file without quitting vim: `:w` (to save) then `:bd` (buffer delete)
   - To switch to the next file: `:bn` (buffer next)
   - To switch to the previous file: `:bp` (buffer previous)

3. For the `nano` text editor:
   - To close the current file: Ctrl+X, then Y to save (if needed), then Enter
   - To switch between open files: Ctrl+,

4. For most graphical text editors (like gedit):
   - Click the close button (usually an X) on the file's tab
   - Use Ctrl+W to close the current file
   - Use Ctrl+PageUp or Ctrl+PageDown to switch between open files

Remember, the exact keystrokes or commands may vary slightly depending on your specific Linux distribution and the version of the software you're using. Always check the program's help documentation (often accessible via F1 key or by typing 'man [program_name]' in the terminal) for the most accurate information.
